//LOTTERY PLAN/PSEUDO CODE
//THIS IS NOT C# CODE BUT PROVIDES A GUIDELINE SO YOU CAN CODE IN C#

//INPUT
accept 3 textboxes of winning number digits

//setup your own Random number generator object
Random myRandomNumberObject = new Random();

//PROCESSING
//set looping counter
number of attempts = 0;


WHILE/LOOP (true)
{
  //Track number of attempts
  number of attempts++;

  if ( number of attempts <= 1000  &&  Match? == false )
     { 'continue looping'}
  else
     { break; (out of the loop)}

  Generate a Random Number for each of 3 digits
  //get next random digit generated from 0 to 9, for your generated digit position 1
  myGenerated1stDigit = myRandomNumberObject.Next(10);
  myGenerated2ndDigit = myRandomNumberObject.Next(10);
  myGenerated3rdDigit = myRandomNumberObject.Next(10);

  //Compare Random digits to winning digits

  if (random # = winning #)
    { Match? = true;  }
  else
    { Match? = false; }

  Display Each Attempt in ListBox

}

WHILE/LOOP (end of loop)


//(now you are outside of the loop/after the loop is finished)

//OUTPUT
if (Match? == true)
  {
   Message = "You Won - it took _____  attempts"
   backcolor = green
  }
else
  {
   Message = "No Match - after trying _______  attempts"
   backcolor = red
  }

Display Message, put data in Labels etc.

//alternate to using while loop is a For loop, something like:
//FOR ( i=1 ; i <=1000 && Match? == false ; i++) - POSSIBLE ALTERNATE OF USING A WHILE, BUT YOU WILL HAVE TO REVISE
